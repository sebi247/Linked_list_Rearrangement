# Linked List Rearrangement Algorithms

Algorithm Overview

## 1. Append if Miss

+	The algorithm adds a new element to the end of the linked list only if it's not already present in the list.
+	Traverse the linked list.
+	Check if the given element is already present in the list.
+	If the element is not present, append it to the end of the list.

## 2. Move to Front

+	The algorithm moves an accessed element to the front of the list, assuming it will be accessed again soon.
+	Traverse the linked list to find the target element.
+	If the target element is found, remove it from its current position.
+	Add the target element to the front of the list.

## 3. Frequency Count

+	The algorithm rearranges the elements in the linked list based on their access frequency, with the most frequently accessed elements at the front.
+	Maintain an auxiliary data structure (e.g., a HashMap) to store the frequency count of each element in the list.
+	Whenever an element is accessed, increment its frequency count in the auxiliary data structure.
+	If an element's frequency count changes, rearrange the list by moving the element to the appropriate position based on its frequency.
+	Ensure that the list remains sorted in descending order of frequency.
